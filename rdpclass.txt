Connect to a terminal server with default options, which can be overridden, and a host (or ip-address) as required parameter.
    The default options are to connect as a domain administrator in a full-screen window.
    Changeable options are program parameters, username and window geometry.

    Example:
	r = Rdp('hostname')
	r.launch()

    Change default options:
	r.user = 'guestuser [-d domain]'
	r.geometry = '-g 800x600'
	r.parms = '-n -a 16'

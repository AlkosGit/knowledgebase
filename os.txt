To correctly deploy a Python application on Linux with Gnome/KDE, a .desktop file needs to be created.
	Also, to get rid of the standard Tk icon extra code is required.

	Create desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications:
		[Desktop Entry]
		Version=1.0
		Name=Playlist Manager
		GenericName=Playlist Manager
		Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/alkos/Sources/playlistmanager/main.py %u
		Path=/home/alkos/Sources/playlistmanager/
		Terminal=false
		Icon=mpv
		Type=Application
		StartupNotify=true
		StartupWMClass=playlistmanager

	The 'StartupWMClass' needs to be present in Python/Tkinter code:
		root = Tk(className='playlistmanager')
